# Cover Letter

```{epigraph}
_The symbol of all relationships among [rational] men, the moral symbol of respect for human beings, is the trader. We, who live by values, not by loot, are traders, both in matter and in spirit. A trader is a man who earns what he gets and does not give or take the undeserved._

-- _Ayn Rand_

Dear Sir or Madam

As a skilled and experienced data science professional, I am writing to express my interest
and demonstrate my motivation to fulfill the position as Data Scientist at SMG. 
After several years of experience working in interdisciplinary teams, with complex and data-intensive models, 
I'm confident that I would prove a valuable addition to your team. 

Fascinated from the beginning with complex mathematical problems, I started my career working 
with transportation models. 
Within this field I could gather valuable hands-on experience with all things data,
from gathering and processing it, to building, calibrating and analyzing complex simulations and statistical models,
up to the invaluable activities around it such as automating workflows and configuring CI/CD and MLOps pipelines.

From my experience with spatial and transport data, I could particularly benefit your analytics on real estate and vehicle sales platforms. The exploration of relationships with demographics (e.g. from the [Synthetic Population](https://www.swissubase.ch/en/catalogue/studies/13439/17244/datasets/1314/2143/overview)), points-of-interest (e.g. from [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map%253D8%252F46.825%252F8.224)) and accessibility to transport (e.g. from the [national transport model](https://zenodo.org/record/5700957)) could lead to new insights, potentially leading to a new spatial visualization dashboard and/or statistical spatial models. 

Personally I enjoy working in teams and finding peers to exchange ideas and learn from. 
You'll find me always motivated by complex problems and willing to take responsibility 
when it comes to developing new ways of adding value to the organisation. 

Please take your time to review my application for further details. 
I'll be delighted to discuss them in person with you.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,

Davi Guggisberg Bicudo
