Dear Sir or Madam

As a skilled and experienced data science professional, I am writing to express my interest
and demonstrate my motivation to fulfill the position as Data Scientist at Julius Bär. 
After several years of experience working in interdisciplinary teams, with complex and data-intensive models, 
I'm confident that I would prove a valuable addition to your team. 

Fascinated from the beginning with complex mathematical problems, I started my career working 
with transportation models. 
Within this field I could gather valuable hands-on experience with all things data,
from gathering and processing it, to building, calibrating and analyzing complex simulations and statistical models,
up to the invaluable activities around it such as automating workflows and configuring CI/CD and MLOps pipelines.

In my latest project, I set up a model with the Gradient-Boosted Trees algorithm using
the traditional Python data-science stack. In it, part of the model exploration phase involved 
the use of interpretability methods such as the SHAP library. 
In this project data I worked with data preparation and analysis with SQL and have 
the experiments and models tracked using MLFlow. 

Personally I enjoy working in teams and finding peers to exchange ideas and learn from. 
You'll find me always motivated by complex problems and willing to take responsibility 
when it comes to developing new ways of adding value to the organisation. 

Please take your time to review my application for further details. 
I'll be delighted to discuss them in person with you.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,

Davi Guggisberg Bicudo
